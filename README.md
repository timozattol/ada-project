Repository for the Applied Data Analytics course project

# Abstract
The goal of the project is to analyse a set of geolocalized tweets in Switzerland, to build a map of Switzerland similar to the one of [Happy Maps](http://goodcitylife.org/happymaps/). We will focus on one feature, "is the tweet positive or negative?". We will provide an interactive map, that takes a keyword as input, such as "CFF" (Swiss train company). It will filter the tweets containing this keyword, and show the average / mean of the "positiveness" of the tweets on a map, using the geolocalization tags.

# Data description
Geolocalized tweets from 20xx up to 20xx, located in Switzerland, gathered by xx. Licence?

# Feasibility and Risks
The main challenges of the project are:
* Big data: the dataset is huge and we might need to get help of a cluster to process all of the data.
* Sparsity: swiss people are not very active on Tweeter, and the regions out of the big cities might contain very sparse information.
* Geolocalization: we don't know yet the fraction of the tweets that are geolocalized
* Languages: Switzerland contains a big fraction of tweets in English, French, Swiss-German and Swiss-Italian. It will be difficult to compare them together. One solution is to only focus on English tweets, or we might use a translation API.
* Other?

# Deliverables
The deliverables are:
* The source code of the project, in the form of python files / a python notebook.
* A pdf presenting the main results, such as maps, tables, statistical analysis of the results
* The interactive map
